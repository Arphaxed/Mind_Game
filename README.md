# Advanced Quiz Game

## Overview
This is an interactive quiz game designed to test your knowledge on basic computing concepts. The game presents multiple-choice questions (though they can be adapted to free-answer questions as well), tracks how quickly you answer, and calculates your score based on the number of correct answers.

## Features
- Randomized questions from a predefined question bank.
- Tracks the time taken to answer each question.
- Provides immediate feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
- Displays the total score and time taken after the quiz is finished.
- Allows the player to retry the quiz after completing it.

## Requirements
This script is written in Python 3.x and uses the following modules:
- `random` (for randomizing question order)
- `time` (for tracking the time taken to answer each question)

These modules are part of the Python Standard Library, so no additional installations are needed.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the script by typing:
   ```bash
   python quiz_game.py
